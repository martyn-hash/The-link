# Using Notes in Projects - User Guide

Notes capture important information that stays relevant over time. Unlike communications which record specific interactions, notes are evergreen reference material that helps everyone working with a client.

## What Makes Notes Different from Communications

This is a key concept to understand.

### Communications

Communications record **what happened**:
- "Called John on 15th Jan, discussed year-end deadline"
- "Sent email with tax return draft"
- "Client replied confirming approval"

These are time-stamped events in a timeline.

### Notes

Notes capture **what you need to know**:
- "Client travels for the first two weeks of every month"
- "Never call on Fridays - office closes at noon"
- "Use bank account ending 7234 for HMRC payments"
- "Key contact for payroll is Sarah, not John"

These are facts that stay true across multiple projects and time periods.

## When to Use Notes

Notes are your team's shared memory. Use them for:

### Client Preferences

- Preferred contact method
- Best times to reach them
- Communication style preferences
- Special arrangements or agreements

### Recurring Information

- Regular travel patterns
- Seasonal business variations
- Annual deadlines specific to this client
- Payment quirks or processing notes

### Important Context

- Family or personal circumstances affecting availability
- Business partners who need to be consulted
- Staff who handle different areas
- Historical decisions and why they were made

### Warnings and Reminders

- Sensitive topics to avoid
- Past issues to be aware of
- Special handling requirements
- Things that worked well or didn't

## Creating Notes

2. Click **Add Note**
3. Enter a clear title
4. Write your note content
5. Click **Save**

*Insert Screenshot of the Add Note dialog here.*

### Writing Good Note Titles

Your title should tell people what's inside at a glance:

| Good Titles | Poor Titles |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Client unavailable first 2 weeks monthly" | "Availability" |
| "HMRC bank account details" | "Bank info" |
| "Key contacts and their responsibilities" | "People" |
| "Year-end preparation checklist" | "Notes" |

### Rich Text Formatting

The note editor supports rich formatting:

- **Bold** and *italic* for emphasis
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Headings to organise longer notes
- Links to external resources

Use formatting to make notes scannable. Colleagues should find key information in seconds.

## Attaching Files to Notes

Sometimes a document is the best way to capture information.

### Adding Attachments

1. When creating or editing a note, click the attachment area
2. Select files from your computer
3. Files upload and attach to the note
4. Click **Save** to complete

*Insert Screenshot of a note with attachments here.*

### What to Attach

- Reference documents (contracts, agreements)
- Templates specific to this client
- Scanned forms they frequently use
- Diagrams or process flows
- Any document worth keeping with the note

### Viewing Attachments

## Client Notes vs Project Notes

Notes can be created at two levels.

### Client-Level Notes

Created from the Client's Notes tab, these apply to the whole client relationship:

- Available across all projects
- General information about the client
- Long-term reference material

### Project-Linked Notes

Created from a Project's Notes tab, these relate to specific work:

- Linked to one project
- Specific to that piece of work
- Still visible at the client level

*Insert Screenshot showing the "Related To" column in the notes table here.*

### The "Related To" Column

When viewing notes, you'll see what each note is connected to:

- **Client** - A general client note
- **Weekly Payroll** - Linked to a specific project type
- **Annual Accounts** - Another project type example

This helps you understand the context at a glance.

---

## Filtering Notes

When a client has many notes, filters help you find what you need.

### Filter Options

Click the filter dropdown to show:

- **All Notes** - Everything
- **Client Only** - Notes not linked to any project
- **[Project Type Name]** - Notes for a specific project type

*Insert Screenshot of the notes filter dropdown here.*

### In Project View

When viewing notes from within a project:

- The filter defaults to **This Project**
- You see notes specific to this project plus client-level notes
- Change the filter to see notes from other project types if needed

This keeps you focused on relevant information while working.

---

## Viewing and Editing Notes

### Opening a Note

Click the **View** button on any note to see the full content. The note opens in a panel showing:

- Title
- Full content with formatting
- Attachments
- Who created it and when

*Insert Screenshot of the View Note modal here.*

### Editing Notes

Notes can be updated as information changes:

1. Open the note
2. Click **Edit**
3. Make your changes
4. Click **Save**

The original creation date stays, but updates are tracked.

### When to Update vs Create New

**Update** when:
- The fact has changed
- You're correcting an error
- Adding to existing information

**Create new** when:
- The topic is different
- The old note is still valid history
- You want both versions visible

## Tips for Effective Notes

### Keep Notes Current

Outdated notes can mislead colleagues. Review and update when circumstances change.

### One Topic Per Note

It's easier to find a specific note when each covers one thing. Instead of one giant "Client Info" note, create separate notes for:

- Contact preferences
- Bank details
- Key dates
- Special instructions

### Be Specific

Vague notes aren't helpful. Compare:

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Client can be difficult" | "Client prefers detailed explanations before proceeding with anything unusual. Take time to walk through options." |
| "Payroll issues" | "Payroll deadline is 15th but client often submits late. Send reminders on the 10th and 13th." |

### Include the "Why"

When noting a preference or rule, explain why if you know:

- "Don't call on Fridays - office closes at noon for team meetings"
- "Always copy Sarah on emails - she manages John's calendar"

The reason helps colleagues adapt when situations change.

### Think About New Team Members

Write notes as if someone new will read them. Include enough context that they can act on the information without asking questions.

## Notes and Project Handovers

Notes shine when work transfers between team members.

### Preparing for Handover

Before passing work to a colleague:

1. Review existing notes for accuracy
2. Add any knowledge you've gained
3. Flag critical information
4. Remove anything outdated

### Picking Up Work

When taking over a project:

1. Read all client-level notes first
2. Then read project-specific notes
3. You'll understand quirks and preferences quickly
4. Less time asking, more time doing

---

## Summary

Notes are your team's collective memory. They capture the valuable context that makes client work smoother:

- Important facts that stay true over time
- Client preferences and special arrangements
- Warnings, tips, and proven approaches
- Everything a colleague needs to provide great service

When everyone adds valuable notes and keeps them current, the whole team works more effectively. New starters get up to speed faster. Cover arrangements work smoothly. Clients feel looked after by people who truly understand them.

Take two minutes to add a note now - it'll save twenty minutes later.
