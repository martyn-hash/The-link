# Logging Communications in Projects - User Guide

Keeping a complete record of client communications makes everyone's life easier. You can see the full history at a glance, pick up where a colleague left off, and never miss important context.

This guide covers how to log emails, calls, SMS messages, and internal notes so your client records stay complete.

## The Communications Timeline

Every client and project has a Communications tab. This shows a chronological timeline of all interactions.

*Insert Screenshot of the Communications Timeline here.*

### What Appears in the Timeline

- **Emails** - Sent and received (if your Outlook is connected)
- **Phone Calls** - Logged automatically or manually
- **SMS Messages** - Sent texts to clients
- **Internal Notes** - Team observations and reminders
- **Portal Messages** - Client messages from the portal

### Filtering the Timeline

Use the filter buttons at the top to show only certain types:

- **All** - Everything in one view
- **Emails** - Just email conversations
- **Calls** - Phone calls only
- **SMS** - Text messages only
- **Notes** - Internal team notes
- **Messages** - Portal conversations with clients

This helps when you're looking for a specific conversation.

## Logging Emails

Your email integration keeps the timeline up to date automatically. But you can also log emails manually if needed.

### Automatic Email Syncing

If Outlook is connected, emails to and from your clients appear automatically. The system matches emails by:

- The client's email addresses
- Contact person email addresses

No action needed from you - emails just appear in the timeline.

### Viewing Email Threads

Click any email in the timeline to open the full thread. You can:

- Read the complete conversation
- See all replies in order
- View attachments
- See who sent each message

*Insert Screenshot of the Email Thread Viewer here.*

### Sending a New Email

1. Click the **Plus** button in the Communications tab
2. Select **Email**
3. Choose the recipient from the dropdown
4. Write your subject line
5. Compose your message in the rich text editor
6. Click **Send**

The email goes out immediately and appears in the timeline.

*Insert Screenshot of the Email compose dialog here.*

### Rich Text Formatting

The email editor supports:

- **Bold**, *italic*, and underlined text
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Links
- Images (paste directly from clipboard)

Format your emails professionally without leaving the system.

### Adding Attachments

Drag files into the email compose area, or click the attachment button to browse. Common file types are supported.

## Logging Phone Calls

Phone calls can be logged automatically (with RingCentral) or manually after the fact.

### Making Calls with Click-to-Call

If RingCentral is set up, you can call clients directly:

1. Click the **Phone** button in Communications
2. Select the person you want to call
3. Choose their phone number from the dropdown
4. Click **Call**

The phone app opens and dials. When the call ends, it's logged automatically with the duration.

*Insert Screenshot of the Call dialog here.*

### During the Call

While connected, you can:

- **Mute** - Silence your microphone
- **Hold** - Put the call on hold
- **End** - Hang up

The call timer shows how long you've been talking.

### Manual Call Logging

If you made a call outside the system, log it manually:

1. Click the **Plus** button
2. Select **Phone Call** as the type
3. Choose which person you spoke with
4. Enter a subject (what the call was about)
5. Add notes about the conversation
6. Click **Save**

This creates a record even when the call happened elsewhere.

*Insert Screenshot of the manual call log form here.*

### Recording Voice Notes

For quick verbal notes, use the audio recorder:

1. When adding a communication, click the microphone icon
2. Speak your note
3. The recording attaches to the log entry
4. Team members can play it back later

*Insert Screenshot of the audio recorder controls here.*

This is faster than typing when you need to capture detail quickly.

## Sending SMS Messages

Text messages are a fast way to reach clients. They get read much quicker than emails.

### When to Use SMS

SMS works well for:

- Quick reminders ("Your documents are due tomorrow")
- Confirmations ("We've received your files, thank you")
- Urgent requests that need immediate attention
- Following up when emails aren't working

Keep messages short and professional.

### Sending an SMS

1. Click the **Plus** button in Communications
2. Select **SMS**
3. Choose the recipient (must have a mobile number on file)
4. Type your message
5. Click **Send**

*Insert Screenshot of the SMS dialog here.*

### Character Limits

SMS messages have character limits. The counter shows how many characters you've used. Keep messages concise.

### Using SMS Templates

Save time with pre-written templates:

1. Click the **Templates** button (document icon)
2. Browse available templates
3. Click to insert
4. The template text appears in your message
5. Edit as needed before sending

*Insert Screenshot of the SMS Template picker here.*

### Template Variables

Templates can include smart placeholders:

| Variable | What it Becomes |
|----------|-----------------|
| `{firstName}` | The client's first name |
| `{userFirstName}` | Your first name |
| `{calendlyLink}` | Your booking link |

These fill in automatically, making templates personal without extra effort.

### Checking Who Has Mobile Numbers

If someone doesn't appear in the recipient list, they don't have a mobile number on file. Add their number in the People section to enable SMS.

## Adding Communication Notes

Notes are internal records that only your team can see. Use them to capture context that doesn't belong in client-facing messages.

### When to Use Notes

- After a conversation, summarise key points
- Record verbal agreements or promises
- Flag things other team members should know
- Document unusual situations
- Add context that helps future work

### Creating a Note

1. Click the **Plus** button
2. Select **Note** as the type
3. Choose which person it relates to (optional)
4. Enter a subject
5. Write your note in the content area
6. Click **Save**

*Insert Screenshot of the Add Note form here.*

### Notes vs Communications Notes

There are two types of notes in the system:

| Communication Notes | Project Notes |
|---------------------|---------------|
| Appear in the Communications timeline | Appear in the Notes tab |
| Mixed with emails, calls, SMS | Separate, evergreen content |
| Good for interaction records | Good for permanent reference |

Use Communication notes for recording what happened during an interaction. Use Project notes for information that stays relevant over time (covered in the Notes Feature guide).

### Rich Text in Notes

Notes support the same formatting as emails:

- Headings and paragraphs
- Lists and bullet points
- Bold and italic text
- Links

Keep notes scannable so colleagues can find information quickly.

## Portal Messaging

Clients with portal access can send messages directly to your team. These appear in the timeline too.

### What is Portal Messaging?

Portal messaging is secure, two-way communication. Clients log in and send messages. Your team responds. Everything stays in one place.

### Viewing Client Messages

Client messages appear in the timeline with a distinct icon. Click to read the full message.

*Insert Screenshot of a portal message in the timeline here.*

### Responding to Portal Messages

1. Open the message
2. Type your response
3. Click **Send**

Your reply goes directly to the client's portal inbox.

### Starting a Conversation

You can message clients first:

1. Click the **Plus** button
2. Select **Message**
3. Choose the client contact
4. Write your message
5. Click **Send**

The client sees it next time they log in.

### Benefits of Portal Messaging

- No email delivery issues
- Attached to the client record
- Full conversation history

## Viewing Communication History

The timeline shows the full picture of client relationships.

### Chronological Order

Communications appear with the newest at the top. Each entry shows:

- Type (icon indicates email, call, SMS, or note)
- Subject line
- Preview of the content
- Date and time
- Who logged it

### Expanding for Details

Click any communication to see the full content. Long emails or detailed notes expand to show everything.

### Linking to Projects

Communications can be linked to specific projects. When viewing a project's Communications tab, you see only relevant items. The client-level Communications tab shows everything.

## Tips for Better Communication Logs

### Be Consistent

- Log calls promptly after they happen
- Use clear, descriptive subjects
- Include all relevant details

### Keep It Professional

Remember that communication logs might be reviewed by managers or auditors. Write as if anyone might read it.

### Add Context

Don't just say "Spoke to client." Add what you discussed, what they agreed to, and what happens next.

### Use the Right Channel

- **Email** for formal, detailed communication
- **SMS** for quick, urgent messages
- **Calls** for complex discussions
- **Notes** for internal team context

---

## Summary

Complete communication records help your team deliver better service. When every email, call, and conversation is captured:

- New team members can get up to speed quickly
- Cover for colleagues without missing context
- Demonstrate exactly what was communicated and when
- Build stronger client relationships through continuity

Log communications as they happen, and your future self will thank you.
