Continue with Stage 2 of the storage refactoring plan. Extract the Clients domain from server/storage.ts into modular storage classes following the established pattern from Stage 1.

## Context from Previous Work
- Stage 0: Created infrastructure with 15 domain subdirectories and facade pattern
- Stage 1: Successfully extracted Users domain (31 methods) with delegation pattern
- Current facade uses delegation for UserStorage/UserActivityStorage and Proxy for unmigrated methods
- Cross-domain helper injection pattern documented in server/storage/CROSS_DOMAIN_PATTERN.md

## Stage 2 Requirements
Extract Clients domain methods (estimated ~20-25 methods) into:
- server/storage/clients/clientStorage.ts - Core client CRUD operations
- server/storage/clients/companiesHouseStorage.ts - Companies House integration
- server/storage/clients/searchStorage.ts - Super search functionality
- server/storage/clients/index.ts - Export all client storage classes

## Testing Requirements
**IMPORTANT TESTING NOTES:**
1. Login via root page (/) → password tab → use credentials: `admin@example.com` | `admin123`
2. **Known Bug**: Projects page sometimes doesn't load properly. If this happens:
   - Refresh the browser
   - Restart the test from the beginning
3. Always check these notes before starting any browser testing session

For magic link testing:
- Cannot access emails during testing
- Verify magic links by checking database for token creation
- Extract token/code directly from database

## Implementation Steps
1. Identify all client-related methods in storage.ts
2. Create the three storage classes with proper TypeScript typing
3. Update facade (server/storage/index.ts) to delegate client methods
4. Test thoroughly:
   - Client CRUD operations
   - Companies House sync
   - Search functionality
   - Ensure backward compatibility
5. Run comprehensive E2E tests
6. Get architect approval before completing

## Success Criteria
- All client operations work through new delegated storage classes
- Zero breaking changes to existing code
- Companies House integration continues working
- Search functionality remains intact
- All tests pass

Maintain the same delegation pattern as Stage 1 and ensure complete backward compatibility throughout the refactoring.
