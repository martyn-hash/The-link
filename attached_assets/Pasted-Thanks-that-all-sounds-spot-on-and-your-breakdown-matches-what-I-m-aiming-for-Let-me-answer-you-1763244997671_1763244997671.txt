Thanks – that all sounds spot on, and your breakdown matches what I’m aiming for.

Let me answer your questions first and then set out how I’d like to phase the work.

⸻

1. Priority areas

Let’s start with a global component refresh first, then apply it to key screens.

Order of attack:
	1.	Phase 1 – Global theme + shared components
	•	Implement the updated theme tokens (colours, radius, shadows, spacing, typography).
	•	Update the shared primitives:
	•	Page shell / container
	•	Cards / panels
	•	Buttons (primary / secondary / destructive)
	•	Form inputs, selects, textareas
	•	Tabs (convert to pill-style, animated, using brand colours)
	•	Tables (spacing + zebra/row styling)
	•	Goal: I should see the new look appear everywhere without per-page refactors.
	2.	Phase 2 – Key pages (polish + layout tweaks)
	•	Client detail page (the main “hero” view).
	•	Dashboard.
	•	Projects / list views (any high-traffic screens).
	•	Here I’m happy for you to do page-level spacing/layout refinement now that the primitives are nicer.
	3.	Phase 3 – Remaining pages
	•	Sweep through the rest of the app applying the same patterns.
	•	Small polish items, consistency checks, micro-interactions.

If you need a single “reference page” to design against, use the client detail page as the benchmark for the visual system.

2. Dark mode

For now:
	•	Focus on light mode only.
	•	Keep dark mode functional but minimal:
	•	Map the new tokens so dark mode isn’t broken.
	•	No need to spend time perfecting dark theming in this pass.
	•	We can do a dedicated “dark mode polish” later as a separate task.

⸻

3. Mobile considerations

I definitely want the new styling to work well on mobile, but I’m not asking for a full mobile-first redesign.

Key points:
	•	Maintain existing layouts, but:
	•	Ensure cards stack cleanly with good vertical spacing.
	•	Tabs should be horizontally scrollable when they overflow.
	•	Touch targets: minimum ~44px height for buttons, tabs, and table rows.
	•	Typography should scale sensibly so headings don’t dominate small screens.

If you stick to the new spacing + type scale and avoid ultra-tight layouts, mobile should benefit automatically.

4. Brand fonts

Yes:
	•	DM Sans should be the primary UI font across the app.
	•	JetBrains Mono is fine for code / technical snippets only.
	•	Please make sure DM Sans is:
	•	Properly loaded (self-hosted or via font service),
	•	Applied globally via CSS variables / base styles (not just in a few components).

If there are any legacy font declarations hanging around, please standardise everything onto DM Sans.

5. Phased implementation plan

Yes, I’d like you to create and follow a phased implementation plan.

Concrete plan I’d like you to use:
	1.	Phase 1 – Theme + primitives
	•	Update CSS variables / theme config to the new palette, background, text colours, border radius, and shadows.
	•	Implement:
	•	New page background (#F8FAFC) and white cards with rounded corners + soft shadows.
	•	New button styles using the brand palette.
	•	Unified form input styles (borders, focus rings, padding).
	•	Pill-style tabs with proper hover/active states.
	•	Global typography scale (page titles, section titles, body, meta text).
	•	Deliverable: a before/after for at least one page showing the new primitives working.
	2.	Phase 2 – Key pages
	•	Take the client detail page, dashboard, and one key list view and:
	•	Add proper section spacing (24–32px vertical).
	•	Clean up headers, meta rows, and table spacing.
	•	Apply micro-interactions (hover, active states) where appropriate.
	•	Deliverable: these pages should feel like a polished SaaS product.
	3.	Phase 3 – Rollout + polish
	•	Sweep remaining pages for:
	•	Old colours / borders / fonts.
	•	Inconsistent spacing.
	•	Legacy component variants.
	•	Fix inconsistencies and leave a short summary of any known visual debt you’d recommend addressing later.

If you’re happy with that structure, please go ahead and:
	1.	Draft the concrete task list for Phase 1 based on this spec.
	2.	Implement Phase 1 and summarise the changes and any deviations you think are worthwhile.
