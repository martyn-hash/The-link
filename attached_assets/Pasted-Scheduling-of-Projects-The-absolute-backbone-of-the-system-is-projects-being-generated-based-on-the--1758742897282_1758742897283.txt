Scheduling of Projects
The absolute backbone of the system is projects being generated based on the service requirements listed against a client (business) or individual person. 
Ultimately, what needs to happen is nightly the system needs to cycle through all services mapped to clients and people and any that have the next start date of today’s date (the date when the system is cycling through the services), should have their respective project created. 
Then, based on the frequency of the service, the service next due date and service next start date should be reset to the new values ready to be created again in the future. 
For example, if the service is payroll monthly, with a next start date of 22nd of the month and next due date 27th of the month, when the system cycles through and creates the project for this service, the system would then evaluate the frequency (monthly in this example) and set the start date and due date as the 22nd / 27th of the following month. 
There are some exceptions to this though – if the service is a ‘Companies House’ service (accounts & confirmation statements) then we always take the due dates from the companies house api. 
This means there will be scenarios where we create the project (say annual accounts), but the existing service retains the existing next start and next due, until the accounts are submitted and companies house updates, at which point, we’d be getting the new dates from the api that night. 
This part of the system – the creation of projects based on the service schedule is the most fundamentally significant part to the system – this is really the rock and centre that everything else hangs on, because if we get the scheduling wrong, then we miss delivering the services we’re supposed to be delivering for the client. 
As such, we need to build in reporting that confirms the nightly process has worked as expected – for example, we should be able to report on whether there are any services with a date older than today’s date that do not have an open project, as this would suggest the project creation was missed. 
I would also like to build sanity checks that reports on the number of services due that day, the number of projects that were created – essentially, what we need is failure analysis to proactively spot if any projects for services were not created. There should never be this scenario, but we need to be aware if it has occurred. 
The re-scheduling of services needs to be completely robust, with logic that understands how to move the service on weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly or annually. 
When a service is found that requires a project, the system creates the project, moves it to the first kanban stage that exists for that project, and notifies the servicer owner, and any assigned role users for the first kanban stage they have a new task / project. For the nightly run of this, a summary email to the user is what’s needed – not a separate email for each project task. 
Finally, I need the ability to test this part of the system and I cannot wait 24 hours each time in order to test that the system is working – so please propose a set of tools I can use to fastrack the testing of all of the above – for example, some mechanism to trigger the process of the checking services and opening the projects etc. That way, I can create services with todays date, and run a process to cycle through them and I can evaluate the projects that get created and the new service dates. 
I also wonder if we should keep a history of the next start dates and next due dates for the client / individual services for good measure. 

I haven’t got much data in the system yet, so we might need to populate data across services, project types, clients etc, before you can too far into this, but let’s start the planning.
