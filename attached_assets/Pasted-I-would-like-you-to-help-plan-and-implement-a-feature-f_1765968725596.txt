I would like you to help plan and implement a feature for 'client-project-tasks'. 

The idea is this: 

    * At the project type level, we introduce a new feature 'Client Project Task'
    * The user draws on the capabilities of the client request to make a custom form with any variety of questions that the current client request templates can handle. 
    * The user can attach these to a project reminder (for example, we may send out a pre-bookkeeping checklist to the client asking them to confirm they've given us everything we need)
    * Importantly, we should be able to attach stage changing logic to these client project tasks. For example in real life we may create stage 1 of the project as 'Waiting on client info' and the 2nd stage would be 'Ready to start'. The logic may set a process that says 'when client project request is submitted, move project from stage 1 to stage 2 automatically'. 
    * As there is a chance the client project task could be completed BEFORE the project actually gets created in the system, we'd need to store some variable that tells the system whether to start the project at stage 1 or stage n
    * The system should notify the service owner when it is completed. 
    * The system should log and show the completion in the 'Queries' tab of the project, which should maybe have it's sections shown in expandable, but collapsed accordians if more than one query type exists (so currently we have 'Bookkeeping queries', but if we add 'Client Project Tasks', these could either be an expandable accordian, or maybe we prefer to have tabs under queries, but I think the queries tab is the best home for them). 
    * The system should allow for client level override, as we do now for stage change approvals. For example, we create an initial client project task at the project type level asking for x, y & z, but we know client a also has a unique requirement to send us b, c & d, so we make a custom client project task. When the system is sending the reminder (defined in the project type) it checks if there is a client project task, and if there is checks to see if the particular client has a custom version and sends that instead. 
    * Security. We haven't rolled out the portal yet. So the email that goes out should have a simple on brand button to open the form, and we should be able to specify if OTP is required at the project type level. If it is, then access requires a code sent to the same email when the button is pressed. 
    * UI - I want the experience of these client project tasks to be consistent with the UI, and functionality of the bookkeeping queries form - looks similar, auto-save, easy to navigate etc. 



The problem we're solving is that some clients don't send us what we need. We start the work, can't complete it, then have a long wait for the client. So we're going to change the process so that we don't start the work until the client gives us what we need. 

When creating a custom client project task, the user should be able to inherit and re-use any questions / fields already defined in the project type level version. 

Please help me brainstorm this idea, make it world class amazing, and also help me think through the issues, gaps or problems. 

Then, once we've discussed it, you can output a detailed development plan in stages with success criteria to 'Client_Project_Tasks.md' which includes the login details for testing - root page, passwords tab, admin@example.com ~ admin123
