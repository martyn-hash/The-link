Tasks & Task Templates

I want to add an important feature to the app called 'Task Templates'. 

Purpose: 

To allow users to create dynamic forms with different question types for completion by people related to clients. 

In the admin menu (same as project types, services etc). There should be a new menu called 'Task Templates'. 

A task template, would give the admin user the ability to create multiple page forms, that include: 

Here’s the full list of question types currently scoped in the Task Templates feature:
	1.	Short text — single-line text input
	2.	Long text — multi-line input
	3.	Email — validated email format
	4.	Number — numeric input with optional min/max validation
	5.	Date — calendar picker, stored as ISO date
	6.	Single choice (radio) — one option only
	7.	Multi choice (checkbox) — multiple selections allowed
	8.	Dropdown (single) — single select from a dropdown list
	9.	Yes/No — boolean toggle (radio or switch UI)
	10.	File upload — supports file type and size validation, multiple files optional


	•	Signature / e-signature
	•	Conditional display fields


The task template would also include: 

	•	Add/Edit Sections
	•	Each template is an ordered list of sections (drag-drop reordering).
	•	Each section has: Title, Description (client-facing), and its own list of questions.


The task template feature would be used in various scenarios - for example: 

- When onboarding a new client, there might be task templates for ID collection, payroll information, company details. 
- When it's time to prepare a set of accounts, we might have a task template for gathering bank statements, loan agreements et. 
- There might be task templates for all work we carry out for clients. 


Other Information: 

- Task templates should have a category (perhaps also defined in this section 'Task Template Categories')



How will task templates be used? 

- In the client detail screen, in the 'tasks' tab, there should be a 'add tasks' button. 
- The user can either pick one or multiple task templates (along with previewing them to check it's the one they want).

- The user can also press a 'create tasks' button that allows them to create a task template just for that client - for example, the task templates created at the system level will be relevant for multiple clients (onboarding flows, accounts document flows). But sometimes, we need to request specific things from a client - such as 'upload loan agreement' & 'check this box confirm X is correct' etc. So the ability to quickly put together a 'Client Request' (terminology for a task template made just for that client). 


Other Information: 

- Task templates should have a category (perhaps also defined in this section 'Task Template Categories')
- There'll be a task template table, but I think also a task instance table when the task template is applied to a client / person. 
- And we'll need some way of storing answers and documents will need to be added to the documents tab as well. 


Please scope out this work, ask me any clarification questions, and make a plan for the implementation,
