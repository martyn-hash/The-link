You are blocked from effective testing because **the external Replit testing browser cannot reach the running app**, even though the app responds with HTTP 200 **from inside the container** (`curl localhost`). This breaks your feedback loop and must be fixed as a **P1 infrastructure issue**, not worked around.

### What is known (do NOT dispute these facts)
- The app **does run internally** and returns HTTP 200 when curled inside the container.
- The **external testing browser intermittently or consistently cannot reach the app** (“Hmm… We couldn’t reach this app”).
- Restarting sometimes helps briefly, then fails again.
- This is a **multi-process system** (web + cron).
- App startup takes ~10–15 seconds.
- The problem appears **before login**, so it is NOT auth-related.

### Your task
Diagnose and fix **why the external Replit test browser cannot reliably reach the app**, even when the app is running.

### You MUST explicitly verify and report on ALL of the following (no assumptions):

1. **Server binding**
   - Confirm the web server listens on:
     - `process.env.PORT`
     - host `0.0.0.0`
   - Identify the exact file where `app.listen()` (or equivalent) is defined.
   - If it binds to `localhost` or a hard-coded port, FIX IT.

2. **Port mismatch**
   - Print and log:
     - `process.env.PORT`
     - the actual port the server binds to
   - Confirm they match.
   - Confirm Replit is exposing the same port.

3. **Startup order**
   - Confirm the web server starts accepting connections **before**:
     - DB migrations
     - cron workers
     - background initialisation
   - If not, restructure startup so `listen()` happens first.
   - Add explicit logging timestamps.

4. **Health endpoint**
   - Add a `/healthz` endpoint that:
     - returns 200 immediately
     - does NOT touch the database
   - Verify it works externally.

5. **Multi-process interference**
   - Confirm cron workers:
     - do NOT block startup
     - do NOT crash the node process
     - do NOT starve the event loop or DB pool on boot
   - If needed, defer cron startup until after web is live.

6. **Crash / restart loop**
   - Check for:
     - silent crashes
     - restarts
     - port re-binding
   - Add logging on:
     - process start
     - process exit
     - unhandled rejections
     - uncaught exceptions

7. **External reachability**
   - Confirm the **public Replit URL** is reachable once the app logs “listening”.
   - Do NOT rely on internal curl as proof.

### Deliverables (required)
- A **clear root cause** (not “Replit flakiness” unless proven).
- The **exact code changes** made.
- A short explanation of **why this fixes external test reachability**.
- Confirmation that:
  - the app is reachable externally
  - the testing agent can reliably load the login page.

### Rules
- Do not suggest “retry later” or “manual testing”.
- Do not assume infra issues without evidence.
- Treat this as a blocker to all further feature work.

Fix the connectivity first. Only then resume feature testing.
