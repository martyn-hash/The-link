# Projects View Tips & Tricks - User Guide

The Projects screen is your command centre for managing work. With different view modes, powerful filters, and saved views, you can see exactly what you need when you need it.

This guide helps you get the most from every feature.

---

## Understanding the Projects Screen

When you open Projects, you see all your active work. The toolbar at the top gives you control over:

- **What you see** (filters)
- **How you see it** (view modes)
- **Saved configurations** (views)

## View Modes

The system offers five ways to look at your projects. Each suits different situations.

### List View

The traditional table format. Best for:

- Scanning lots of projects quickly
- Seeing specific details in columns
- Sorting by any column
- Bulk actions on multiple items

### Kanban View

A visual board with columns for each stage. Best for:

- Seeing workflow at a glance
- Dragging projects between stages
- Spotting bottlenecks (crowded columns)
- Team huddles and stand-ups

#### Compact Mode in Kanban

Toggle **Compact Mode** to show smaller cards. This fits more projects on screen when you have lots in one stage.

### Pivot View

Cross-tabulate your data for analysis. Best for:

- Counting projects by different dimensions
- Finding patterns (e.g., projects by type and assignee)
- Management reporting
- Answering "how many" questions

## Using Filters

Filters narrow down what you see. Start broad, then add filters to focus.

### Opening the Filter Panel

Click the **Filter** button (funnel icon) in the toolbar. The filter panel opens on the left.

*Insert Screenshot of the Filter Panel here.*

### Available Filters

| Filter | What it Does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Project Type** | Show only certain types (e.g., Payroll, Year End) |
| **Stage** | Show projects at specific stages |
| **Assignee** | Show projects assigned to specific people |
| **Client** | Show projects for certain clients |
| **Status** | Active, completed, inactive, benched |
| **Date Range** | Filter by due date, start date, etc. |
| **Tags** | Custom tags you've applied |

### The Filter Badge

When filters are active, a badge shows how many. This reminds you that you're not seeing everything.

*Insert Screenshot of the filter badge showing a count here.*

### Clearing Filters

Click **Clear All** in the filter panel to reset, or click the X next to individual filters.

---

## Finding Overdue Projects

Overdue projects need attention. The system makes them easy to find.

### Quick Overdue Filter

1. Open the filter panel
2. Look for the **Overdue** quick filter or status filter
3. Select it to show only overdue items

### Visual Indicators

Overdue projects show warning colours (typically red or amber) in both List and Kanban views. You'll spot them immediately.

*Insert Screenshot showing overdue project highlighting here.*

### Sorting by Due Date

In List view, click the **Due Date** column header to sort. Overdue projects appear at the top.

---

## The "Client Also Has" Filter

This powerful filter helps when you're working with one project but need to see related work.

### What It Does

When you're viewing a client's projects, enable "Client Also Has" to see what other active projects exist for that client. This helps you:

- Spot opportunities to combine work
- Avoid conflicting deadlines
- Understand full workload for a client
- Coordinate across project types

### Using It

1. Filter to a specific client or open a client's project list
2. Toggle on "Client Also Has" in filters
3. Related projects appear highlighted or in a separate section

*Insert Screenshot of the Client Also Has filter in action here.*

---

## Working with Lists

List view offers the most control over data presentation.

### Sorting Columns

Click any column header to sort by that column. Click again to reverse the order.

A small arrow shows the current sort direction.

### Column Widths

Drag the divider between column headers to resize. Make important columns wider for easier reading.

---

## Kanban Board Tips

The Kanban view is excellent for visual workflow management.

### Dragging Projects

Click and hold a project card, then drag it to a different column. This changes the project's stage.

*Insert Screenshot of dragging a card on Kanban here.*

### Column Counts

Each column shows how many projects are in that stage. Watch for columns getting too full - that's a bottleneck.

### Scrolling Within Columns

If a column has many projects, scroll within it. Other columns stay visible.

---

## Building Pivot Tables

Pivot views turn your project data into useful summaries.

### Creating a Pivot

1. Switch to Pivot view
2. Drag fields into Rows and Columns areas
3. Choose what to measure (count, sum, etc.)
4. The table updates automatically

*Insert Screenshot of the Pivot Builder interface here.*

### Example Pivots

| Rows | Columns | Shows You |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Assignee | Project Type | Workload distribution per person |
| Stage | Week | Flow of work through stages |
| Client | Status | Which clients have most active work |
| Project Type | Month | Seasonal patterns by work type |

### Exporting Pivot Data

Use the export button to download pivot tables for use in reports or presentations.

---

## Calendar View Tips

The calendar shows projects plotted against time.

### Navigating Months

Use the arrows to move forward and back through months. Or jump to a specific date.

### Project Bars

Projects appear as bars spanning their timeline (start to due date). Overlapping bars show busy periods.

### Clicking for Details

Click any project bar to open the project details. Make quick updates without leaving the calendar.

---

## Building Dashboards

Dashboards combine widgets into custom views.

### Creating a Dashboard

1. Click the **Create Dashboard** button
2. Give it a name and description
3. Choose visibility (private or shared with team)
4. Add widgets

*Insert Screenshot of the Create Dashboard dialog here.*

### Available Widgets

- **Counters** - Show totals (projects in stage X, overdue items)
- **Charts** - Visual graphs of data
- **Lists** - Filtered project lists
- **Progress bars** - Track completion percentages

### Arranging Widgets

Drag widgets to reorder them. The layout saves automatically.

### Setting a Dashboard as Homescreen

Mark one dashboard as your homescreen. It becomes the first thing you see when opening Projects.

---

## Saving Views

When you've set up filters and view mode perfectly, save it for quick access later.

### Save New View

1. Set up your filters and view mode
2. Click the **Views** menu (bookmark icon)
3. Click **Save New View**
4. Give it a descriptive name
5. Click **Save**

*Insert Screenshot of the Save View dialog here.*

### Good View Names

| Situation | Good Name |
|-----------|-----------|
| Your personal workload | "My Active Projects" |
| Team weekly review | "Team Review - All Active" |
| Overdue items | "Overdue - Needs Action" |
| Specific client | "ABC Ltd - All Work" |

### Updating Current Views

If you modify a saved view and want to keep the changes:

1. Open the Views menu
2. Click **Update Current View**
3. The view saves with your new settings

This updates the existing view rather than creating a new one.

---

## Sharing Views with Colleagues

Views can be shared so the whole team benefits.

### Private vs Shared Views

- **Private** - Only you see it
- **Shared** - Everyone in your team can access it

When saving, choose the appropriate visibility.

### Team Views

Shared views appear for all team members. Create team views for:

- Common reporting needs
- Standard team meetings
- Handover situations
- Training purposes

---

## Adding and Removing Columns

In List view, you control which columns appear.

### Showing/Hiding Columns

1. Click the column settings button (often a gear or columns icon)
2. Check or uncheck columns to show or hide them
3. Changes apply immediately

*Insert Screenshot of the column visibility settings here.*

### Available Columns

Common columns include:

- Project Type
- Client
- Description
- Assignee
- Stage
- Due Date
- Start Date
- Status
- Progress
- Tags
- Custom fields

### Column Order

Drag column headers left or right to reorder them. Put the most important information first.

## Changing Pagination

When you have many projects, pagination controls how many show at once.

### Page Size Options

Choose how many projects per page:

- 25 - Quick loading, more pages
- 50 - Balanced
- 100 - See more at once
- All - Everything on one page (may be slow with many projects)

*Insert Screenshot of the pagination controls here.*

### Navigating Pages

Use the page numbers or Previous/Next buttons to move through pages.

The pagination bar shows:
- Current page number
- Total number of pages
- Total project count

### Navigation Tips

- Use First/Last buttons to jump quickly
- The current page highlights so you know where you are
- Page settings save with your view

### Why It Matters

Smaller page sizes load faster. Larger page sizes mean less clicking. Find your preferred balance.

---

## Tasks & Reminders Workspace

The Projects screen has a workspace toggle to switch between Projects and Tasks.

### Accessing Tasks

Click the **Tasks & Reminders** toggle in the toolbar. The view switches to show your task list.

*Insert Screenshot of the Tasks workspace toggle here.*

### The Badge Count

A number badge shows how many open tasks and reminders you have. Keep this low!

---

## Tips for Power Users

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Learn any available shortcuts for faster navigation. Common ones:

- Arrow keys for navigation
- Enter to open
- Escape to close modals

### Start with Views

If you find yourself applying the same filters repeatedly, save a view. One click replaces many.

### Combine Filters Thoughtfully

Too many filters might hide things you need to see. Start broad, then narrow.

### Review Saved Views Periodically

Delete views you no longer use. Rename unclear ones. Keep your view menu clean.

### Use the Right View for the Task

- Checking status quickly? Kanban
- Finding specific projects? List with filters
- Planning capacity? Pivot
- Scheduling? Calendar
- Daily overview? Dashboard

---

## Summary

The Projects screen is flexible by design. You can:

- Switch between five view modes
- Filter to see exactly what you need
- Save configurations for instant access
- Share useful views with colleagues
- Build custom dashboards
- Control every aspect of the display

### Time Savings in Practice

Consider the daily benefits:

| Without Saved Views | With Saved Views |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Apply 4 filters each morning | One click to "My Work Today" |
| Switch modes repeatedly | Jump straight to Kanban review |
| Remember filter combinations | System remembers for you |
| Set up the same display each time | Instant access to your setup |

### Team Efficiency

When views are shared:

- New starters use proven view configurations
- Teams align on the same information displays
- Handovers happen smoothly
- Everyone sees what they need to see

### Better Decision Making

The right view at the right time means:

- Spotting overdue work immediately
- Understanding workload distribution
- Planning ahead with calendar views
- Tracking progress with dashboards

Take time to set up your preferred views. The minutes invested pay back every time you open the screen and see exactly what you need, instantly.

Your workday gets smoother when information is always one click away.
